# Guided-Trajectory-Neural-Net
This project builds a machine-learning surrogate model using data generated from a quasi-6-DoF physics simulator replacing numerical integration with a neural network that can predict full 3-D projectile trajectories—including altitude, downrange motion, and lateral deflection hundreds of times faster while maintaining meter-level accuracy.
